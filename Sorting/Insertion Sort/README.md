# Insertion Sort

**Description:**  
Insertion sort is an algorithm that gradually builds a sorted portion of the array by inserting each next element into its correct position.

**Complexity:**
- Time: 
  - Best case: O(n) (array is already sorted)
  - Average/Worst case: O(n^2)
- Space: O(1) â€” in-place

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
```
