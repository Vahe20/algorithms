# Counting Sort

**Description:**  
Counting Sort is an algorithm for arrays of integers that counts the occurrences of each element and builds a sorted array.

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n + k), where n is the size of the array and k is the range of values
- Space: O(n + k)

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: [4, 2, 2, 8, 3, 3, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 8]
```
