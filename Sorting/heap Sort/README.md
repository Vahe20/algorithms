# Heap Sort

**Description:**  
Heap Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.  
It builds a heap from the input data and repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element to produce a sorted array.

**Complexity:**
- Best/Average/Worst case: O(n log n)
- Memory: O(1)

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: [1, 6, 34, 23, 643, 2, 1, 86, 32, 6, 5, 26, 87]
Output (ascending): [1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 6, 23, 26, 32, 34, 86, 87, 643]
