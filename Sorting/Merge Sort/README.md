# Merge Sort

**Description:**  
Merge Sort is a "divide and conquer" algorithm. It splits the array into halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges them into a single sorted array.

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n log n) in all cases
- Space: O(n) â€” due to temporary arrays during merging

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
Output: [5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13]
```
