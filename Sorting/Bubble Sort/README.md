# Bubble Sort

**Description:**  
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

**Complexity:**
- Time: 
  - Best case: O(n)
  - Average/Worst case: O(n^2)
- Space: O(1) â€” in-place

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: [5, 2, 9, 1]
Output: [1, 2, 5, 9]
```
