# Selection Sort

**Description:**  
Selection sort is an algorithm that divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted part. At each step, it selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and places it at the end of the sorted part.

**Complexity:**
- Time: O(n^2) in all cases
- Space: O(1) â€” in-place

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```
