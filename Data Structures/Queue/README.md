# Queue Data Structure

A **Queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

## Methods

- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove an element from the front of the queue.
- **Peek**: View the front element without removing it.
- **IsEmpty**: Check if the queue contains no elements.
- **isFull**: Check if the queue has reached its maximum capacity (mainly for fixed-size queues).
- **getSize**: Get the current number of elements in the queue.
- **print**: Display all elements in the queue in order.
- **clear**: Remove all elements from the queue.
- **toArray**: Convert the queue contents to an array for easier.
