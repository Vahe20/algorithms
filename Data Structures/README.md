# ðŸ§  Data Structures

This folder contains a collection of **custom JavaScript implementations** of classic and advanced **data structures**, written for educational and practical use.
Each structure is implemented **from scratch**, focusing on clarity, performance, and modularity.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

Each data structure resides in its own directory and includes:
- **Source code (`.js`)** â€” clean, well-documented implementation.
- **Dedicated documentation (`.md`)** â€” explaining the structureâ€™s purpose, API, and usage examples.
- **Tests or examples** â€” showing how to use it in real scenarios.

## ðŸ“‚ Available Structures

- [**DynamicArray**](./DynamicArray) - A resizable array that automatically expands its capacity as elements are added.
- [**LinkedList**](./LinkedList) - A dynamic, node-based structure allowing efficient insertion and removal at any position.
- [**DeQue**](./DeQue) - A double-ended queue implemented using a block-based (bucket) storage system for efficient operations at both ends.
- [**Stack**](./Stack) - A last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure for managing ordered data.
- [**Queue**](./Queue) - A first-in, first-out (FIFO) structure for orderly processing of elements.
- [**PriorityQueue**](./PriorityQueue) - A queue where each element has a priority, and elements are served based on priority.
