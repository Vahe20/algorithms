# Stack Data Structure

A **Stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed.

## Methods

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: View the top element without removing it.
- **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.
- **isFull**: Check if the stack is full.
- **getSize**: Return the number of elements in the stack.
- **clear**: Remove all elements from the stack.
- **print**: Display all elements in the stack.
- **toArray**: Convert the stack to an array representation.
